Assignment 9
Implementation of the labeling algorithm to generate assembly language code from the labeled tree of intermediate code.
Input: Intermediate code in three-address code format, RSTACK a stack of r registers (R0,R1,...,Rr-1), TSTACK a stack of temporary memory locations (T0,T1,...,).
       Instruction set 
      MOV A,B  ; atleast one of A and B should be register or memory
      ADD A,B  ; A=A+B, A and B are registers 
      SUB A,B  ; A=A-B, A and B are registers 
      MUL A,B  ; A=A*B, A and B are registers 
      DIV A,B  ; A=A/B, A and B are registers 
Output: Assembly language equivalent of the intermediate code with minimum register and temporary memory allocation.
